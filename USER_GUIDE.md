     - Columns A-F, N-O will be extracted
   - **RedIQ File**: Contains subject property data
     - Must have "Floor Plan Summary" tab

     - Total units
     - Average rent PSF
     - Other key metrics

3. The file downloads automatically with a timestamped name

## Data Logic

### Subject vs Competitor Data

The tool follows this logic:

- **For Subject Property**: Always use RedIQ data (more accurate, actual property data)
- **For Competitor Properties**: Use ApartmentIQ data (web-scraped advertised rates)

This means:
- RedIQ data replaces AIQ data for the subject property only
- The subject property appears with both:
  - **Market Rent**: From RedIQ (advertised rates)
  - **AMC Rent**: From RedIQ (in-place/actual rents)
- Competitor properties show only AIQ data

### Column Mapping

| Output Column | AIQ Source | RedIQ Source |
|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Property | Column A | Subject name (user input) |
| Floor Plan | Column B | Column A |
| Bed | Column C | Column D |
| Bath | Column D | Column E |
| Sq Ft | Column E | Column F |
| Units | Column F | Column G |
| Market Rent | Column O | Column P |
| AMC Rent | - | Column Q (In-Place Rent) |
| Last 5 Leases | - | Column S |
| Rent PSF | Calculated | Calculated |

### Calculated Fields

- **Rent PSF** = Market Rent Ã· Square Feet
- Automatically computed for all floor plans

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Fails

**Problem**: File upload shows error message

**Solutions**:
- Verify the file is in Excel format (.xlsx or .xls)
- Check that the required sheet exists with correct name
- Ensure the file isn't corrupted
- Try re-downloading the file from the source system

### Missing Data in Report

**Problem**: Some properties or floor plans don't appear

**Solutions**:
- Check that the data exists in the source file
- Verify the property name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Look at the Import History to see if there were failed records
- Re-upload the file if needed

### Subject Property Not Highlighted

**Problem**: Subject property appears like other properties

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you entered the correct subject property name when uploading RedIQ file
- Name must match exactly (including spaces and capitalization)
- Re-upload the RedIQ file with the correct name

### Export Doesn't Include All Data

**Problem**: Excel export is missing some records

**Solutions**:
- Refresh the Report page to ensure latest data is loaded
- Check that all uploads completed successfully
- Verify no filters are applied (future feature)

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Upload RedIQ first**: This creates the subject property in the system
2. **Use consistent naming**: Ensure property names match exactly across systems
3. **Check import history**: Always verify successful import before proceeding
4. **Review before exporting**: Check the Report page to ensure data looks correct
5. **Keep source files**: Save original AIQ and RedIQ files for reference

## Data Storage

- You can re-upload files to update data
- Import history tracks all uploads with timestamps
- Previous data is not automatically deleted (allows historical tracking)
